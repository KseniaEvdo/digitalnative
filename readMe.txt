Analyzing this activity, we can say that working with user stories provided a clear outline of the development process.
It was immediately clear what needed to be done. A picture of the shape appeared in my head and an understanding of where to start. 
The user stories outlined specific requirements, such as the need to verify the form and user feedback. Having test cases was helpful. 

I usually use AI like this: I ask it to create a simple form (template) and then I start to develop it. I also use AI for some functions in JS.
For example, I have not yet encountered the Luhn algorithm, I have redone the code given to us (in C++) using AI, working out what it is in parallel with it.
This help accelerated the development process and allowed us to take a fresh look at solving common problems. However, the use of generative AI also comes with risks.
The code created with the help of AI is not always real. Sometimes errors or inaccuracies appear. Having no experience in development, it is impossible to write code with AI alone.
AI is a useful tool that we must be able to manage. She gives us a direction, then we correct it, add it ourselves.
Therefore, it is extremely important to carefully check and test the code created using AI.

The code was implemented in stages, I started with the HTML structure, then CSS for styling, and finally JavaScript for form validation and error handling.
Key features such as validateName, validateCreditCard and checkLuhn have been added to ensure that the data entered by the user is correct.

During this process, I realized the importance of a structured approach to development. User stories and pre-defined test cases provide a solid foundation for building reliable applications.
In addition, I gained a deeper understanding of the methods of checking forms and the Moon algorithm for checking credit cards. 

I wouldn't want to do it any other way, I think it's a great exercise.
